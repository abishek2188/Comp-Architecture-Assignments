# Computer Architecture Assignments
These assignments are of the course COL216 - Computer Architecture offered in Second Semester, 2020-21 in IIT Delhi. A1 and A2 are implemented in MIPS assembly language. A3, A4, A5 and Minor are implemented in C++.

## Assignment 1:
Implementation of a MIPS Assembly Program for obtaining the area under a curve formed by joining successive points by a straight line.

For more details, click [here](A1/README.md).

## Assignment 2:
Implementation of a MIPS Assembly Program for evaluating an expression in postfix format.

For more details, click [here](A2/README.md).
## Assignment 3:
Development of an interpreter for a subset of MIPS assembly language instructions. Input is taken from an input file and executed line by line.

For more details, click [here](A3/README.md).

## Minor Exam:
The interpreter developed in A3 is enhanced with two new features, making it a MIPS simulator. The features are-

* Main Memory Model (2D-DRAM) Design
* Non-blocking Memory Access

For more details, click [here](Minor/README.md).

## Assignment 4:
If we service the memory requests in the input order, the DRAM may change rows ON EVERY ACCESS which results in poor performance. 

In this assignment, memory request ordering is performed in the MIPS Simulator to improve the performance.

For more details, click [here](A4/README.md).

## Assignment 5:
In this assignment, the earlier designed DRAM request manager is extended to the multicore CPU case. There are now N CPU cores, each running a different MIPS program,
and sending DRAM requests to a Memory Request Manager which interfaces with the DRAM.
