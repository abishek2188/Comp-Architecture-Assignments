#this testcase is meant to check all possible selections by the MRM of the code
#in t1, we have a dependent addi instruction and thus the lw instruction on which this instruction has to be executed as a priority 
#because there is an undergoing sw instruction of t2 in DRAM, a sw instruction of same row as the undergoing instruction is also queued
#the code is designed in such a way that this queued instruction of same row will be executed first
#the priority lw instruction will be present in the priority queue until we keep on getting normal instructions of same row.

	addi $t0, $t0, 1
