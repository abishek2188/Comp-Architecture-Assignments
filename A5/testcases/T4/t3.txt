#this testcase is meant to show the effect of queue size of cores on the algorithm of MRM. 
#t1 contains two memory instructions of different rows whereas t2 contains three memory instructions of same row. 
#the first sw of t1 is executed followed by the three memory instructions of t2  
#the second memory instruction of t1 is ececuted last as size of queue of a core is considered when same row instructions are not present in the current core.
#t3 will be executed and all the instructions even though the instructions of different rows as it is a priority instruction.

main:
	sw $t0, 1000($zero)
	lw $t1, 2000($zero)
	add $t2, $zero, $t1
exit:
